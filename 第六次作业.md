###Abstract: the precise strike problem
###the physical principle:
projection motion model:
######if we don't consider the air drag force and the variation of the density of air via height. the whole system is charged by the Newton's law. We separate the force along two perpendicular direction X,Y. Then we get two ODE:$$\frac{d^{2}x}{dt^2}=0$$,$$\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^2}=g$$（in this problem,I let g be $$9.8m/s^2$$)to solve this problem with the Euler method, we transform these two two-order ODEs to four one-order 0DEs:$$\frac{dx}{dt}=v_{x},\frac{dy}{dt}=v_{y},\frac{dv_{x}}{dt}=0,\frac{dv_{y}}{dt}=g$$ Once we determine the step length we can solve this problem easily.
To make this moder more realistic, we add the air drag and density variation. The air drag:$$F=-b_{1}v-b_{2}v^2$$ since the linear order item is very small, we only consider the second order item and the direction of this force is along the direction of motion.
(In this problem, I set the $$\frac{b_{2}}{m}=4{\times}10^{-5}$$)
Now, there are two approximation:one is consider the atomsphere as a isothermal model,or consider it as a adiabatic model. 
the isothermal approximation:$$\rho={\rho}_{0}exp(\frac{-y}{y_{0}})$$
the adiabatic appromimation:$$\rho={\rho}_{0}(1-\frac{ay}{T_{0}})^{\alpha}$$
the relationship between the air density and the air drag is:$$F^{*}_{drag}=\frac{\rho}{{\rho}_{0}}F_{drag}(y=0）$$
then the motion equation is:$$\frac{dx}{dt}=v_{x},\frac{dy}{dt}=v_{y},\frac{dv_{x}}{dt}=-(1-\frac{ay}{T_{0}})^{\alpha}b_{2}vv_{x},\frac{dv_{y}}{dt}=g-(1-\frac{ay}{T_{0}})^{\alpha}b_{2}vv_{y}$$
Since actually the temperature of the air isn't equal at different height, so in this problem I only consider the adiabatic approximation(set the a=0.0065,alpha=2.5,T0=300K).
###The programming process
######In order to have a clear sense of this problem,I first solve the ideal projection problem(without air drag). Since these ideal ODEs can be solved analytically, I use this solution:$$x=v_{0}cos{\theta}t,y=v_{0}sin{\theta}t-\frac{1}{2}gt^2$$,to get the relation between initial speed and projection angle when the target location is determined.$$v^2=\frac{gx_0^2}{2cos{\theta}(x_0sin{\theta}-y_0cos{\theta})}$$In order to hit a target in the coordinate(x0,y0),the projection angle should at least bigger than arctan(y0/x0). So I set ten angles between 90 and arctan(y0/x0),which is their even division. Then use the relation equation to get the initial speed and plot the graph.(in this problem we let the step length be 0.001)
######the target location of the first gragh is (200.0m,100.0m).I let the program to import the projection angle and initial speed.

######Then,I begin to add the air drag into this model.to my disappointment, when the speed is very big the deviation with the ideal situation is quite large. So I can't just add some small variation on the basis of the initial speed we get in the ideal situation to hit the target precisely. So I use the function recursion to let the speed change via  the distance to the target.
In this way, I write a program to let the user input the target location and the program export the initial angle and speed.

this is the data of target location (10.0m,5.0m). 
Since this program I write is very sensitive of the step length. There will be a large change of the final result if I increase the step length. Only by set it as 0.001, can the result be more compelling. In that case, once I enlarge the location of the target, the program runs so slow.
I also write a version that not only let the user input the location but also input the projection angle. Then the program will
give the final deviation.
the (X,Y,angle,deviation):
(30,20,40,0.354365167)

Finally, I add some error in the projection angle and initial speed(1% for angle,5% for speed, this error varies evenly in the range not like the Gauss distribution). I just take some value in this range and get their average.
